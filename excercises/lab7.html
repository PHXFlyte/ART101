    <p>Hopefully I don't get points taken off for this, but I think it'd be funny to answer the lab questions in here as a bit.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
    <p><em>What selectors are we using for jQuery?</em> We're using $ to select certain portions of the page, then ".click" and "togglefunction
        to swap between two modes." </p>
    </div>


    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
    <p><em>How does JS know what to expand and close/how does the word change?</em> JS knows what to expand and retract because it looks at nice block span, which uses nice block,
    which is the div that this (and other) text box(es) are in. We change the word with an if/then inside the JS function, changing the visible HTML text.</p>
